# Product Requirements Document: Lazy Loading Implementation
## Split Lease Clone - Performance Optimization Initiative

### Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: August 21, 2025
- **Author**: Development Team
- **Status**: In Development
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The Split Lease clone currently suffers from severe mobile performance issues, with PageSpeed scores of 30-50 on mobile versus 80-90+ on desktop. The primary culprit is a hidden iframe that loads the entire Split Lease application (2-3MB) on initial page load, regardless of user intent.

### Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive lazy loading strategy that defers iframe loading until user intent is detected, reducing initial page weight by 60-70% and improving mobile performance scores by 40-50 points.

### Expected Outcomes
- Mobile PageSpeed score: 70-85 (from current 30-50)
- Initial page load reduction: 2-3MB
- Time to Interactive: 3-5 seconds faster
- Zero functional regression
- Improved user experience on all devices

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate render-blocking resources** on initial page load
2. **Reduce initial payload** by deferring non-critical resources
3. **Improve mobile performance** to match desktop scores
4. **Maintain all existing functionality** without degradation

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Mobile PageSpeed Score | 30-50 | 70-85 | Google PageSpeed Insights |
| Initial Page Size | ~3.5MB | <1MB | Network tab analysis |
| Time to Interactive | 8-10s | 3-5s | Lighthouse metrics |
| First Contentful Paint | 3-4s | <1.5s | Web Vitals |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | >0.25 | <0.1 | Core Web Vitals |

### Non-Goals
- Complete application redesign
- Backend infrastructure changes
- Feature additions or removals
- Browser compatibility changes

## 3. User Stories & Use Cases

### User Stories

**Story 1: Mobile User First Visit**
> As a mobile user visiting the site for the first time, I want the page to load quickly so that I can browse available rentals without frustration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Page loads in under 3 seconds on 4G
- Content is immediately interactive
- No layout shifts during load

**Story 2: Desktop User Sign-In**
> As a desktop user wanting to sign in, I want the authentication modal to appear quickly when I click sign-in.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sign-in modal appears within 500ms of click
- No visible loading delay for return visitors
- Smooth transition animation

**Story 3: Returning User Experience**
> As a returning user, I want the site to anticipate my actions and preload relevant content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Auth system preloads if I've signed in before
- Common actions load instantly
- Browser cache utilized effectively

### Use Case Flows

**UC1: First-Time Visitor Flow**
1. User lands on homepage
2. Static content loads immediately (<1s)
3. User scrolls and explores
4. System detects intent and preloads auth
5. User clicks sign-in
6. Modal appears with minimal delay

**UC2: Power User Flow**
1. User arrives with intent to sign in
2. Hovers over sign-in button
3. System begins preloading auth iframe
4. User clicks sign-in
5. Modal appears instantly (already loaded)

## 4. Technical Requirements

### Architecture Changes

#### Current Architecture
```
Page Load → Load All Resources → Hidden Iframe Active → Ready
           ↓
       [2-3MB overhead]
```

#### New Architecture
```
Page Load → Static Content → Detect Intent → Load on Demand → Display
           ↓                                ↓
       [<500KB]                    [Load only what's needed]
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Remove Hidden Resources (Week 1)
**Objective**: Eliminate unnecessary initial loads

**Tasks:**
1. Remove hidden auth check iframe (`#authCheckIframe`)
2. Replace with lightweight auth check:
   - LocalStorage session check
   - Cookie verification
   - Optional: Lightweight API ping
3. Remove automatic iframe preloading
4. Clean up orphaned setTimeout calls

**Files Affected:**
- `index.html`: Remove lines 471-474
- `script.js`: Remove lines 8-93 (auth check system)
- `script.js`: Remove lines 698-720 (preload function)

#### Phase 2: On-Demand Loading (Week 1)
**Objective**: Load resources only when needed

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Pseudocode structure
const IframeLoader = {
  states: {
    auth: 'NOT_LOADED',
    marketResearch: 'NOT_LOADED'
  },
  
  load(type) {
    if (this.states[type] === 'NOT_LOADED') {
      this.states[type] = 'LOADING';
      // Create and load iframe
      this.states[type] = 'LOADED';
    }
  }
};
```

**Trigger Points:**
- `openAuthModal()` → Load auth iframe
- `openMarketResearchModal()` → Load market research iframe
- Remove all preemptive loading

#### Phase 3: Intent-Based Preloading (Week 2)
**Objective**: Anticipate user needs without impacting performance

**Intent Signals:**
| Signal | Weight | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Mouse near header | Low | Queue preload |
| Hover on sign-in | High | Start preload |
| Scroll > 50% | Medium | Consider preload |
| 3s idle time | Low | Background preload |
| Touch event (mobile) | Medium | Prepare resources |

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Intent detection system
const IntentDetector = {
  score: 0,
  threshold: 50,
  
  signals: {
    mouseNearHeader: 10,
    hoverSignIn: 40,
    scrollHalfway: 20,
    idleTime: 15,
    touchEvent: 25
  },
  
  evaluate() {
    if (this.score >= this.threshold) {
      IframeLoader.preload('auth');
    }
  }
};
```

#### Phase 4: Loading States & UX (Week 2)
**Objective**: Provide smooth user experience during loads

**Visual States:**
1. **Initial**: Empty container, no iframe
2. **Preloading**: Hidden loading, no UI change
3. **Loading**: Visible skeleton/spinner
4. **Loaded**: Full content displayed
5. **Error**: Fallback to direct navigation

**Loading Indicators:**
- Skeleton screens for modal containers
- Progress bar for slow connections
- Fade-in transition when loaded
- Error state with retry option

#### Phase 5: Performance Monitoring (Week 3)
**Objective**: Track and optimize loading performance

**Metrics to Track:**
```javascript
const PerformanceTracker = {
  metrics: {
    timeToFirstIframe: null,
    preloadHitRate: 0,
    averageLoadTime: 0,
    failureRate: 0,
    userWaitTime: []
  },
  
  report() {
    // Send to analytics
  }
};
```
