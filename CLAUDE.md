# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Split Lease website clone - a fully responsive, interactive web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created as a modern recreation of the split.lease website, implementing periodic tenancy rental features.

## Development Context & History

### Project Creation
- Originally created by analyzing the Split Lease website (https://split.lease) 
- Built from scratch using vanilla web technologies (no frameworks)
- Designed to demonstrate modern web development practices
- Repository: https://github.com/splitleasesharath/index_lite

### Key Implementation Decisions
1. **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS for maximum portability
2. **Placeholder Assets**: Uses emoji icons and gradient placeholders instead of images to avoid asset dependencies
3. **GitHub Pages Ready**: Optimized for static hosting without backend requirements
4. **Responsive First**: Mobile-friendly design with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Run local server (Python)
python -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser directly (Windows)
start index.html

# Run local server (Node.js alternative)
npx http-server
```

### Git Operations (LOCAL-ONLY WORKFLOW)
**CRITICAL RULE**: COMMIT EVERY CHANGE IMMEDIATELY - No remote operations
```bash
# STEP 1: Make your changes to files
# (edit files here)

# STEP 2: Stage changes immediately after each modification
git add [modified files]

# STEP 3: Commit changes with descriptive message
git commit -m "Your commit message with context"

# Alternative: One-line commit for quick changes
git add . && git commit -m "Description of change"
```

**MANDATORY LOCAL WORKFLOW**: 
- Every single file change MUST be committed immediately
- No pushing or pulling from remote repositories
- Use atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Descriptive commit messages for every change
- This ensures complete change history without remote dependencies

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Repository is configured for GitHub Pages
- Site URL: https://splitleasesharath.github.io/index_lite
- Deployment: Automatic on push to main branch
- Settings: Repository Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch (root)

### Core Components

#### Interactive Schedule System
- **Day Selector**: Clickable badges for S M T W T F S
- **Schedule Types**: Weeknight, Weekend, Monthly presets
- **Animation Controls**: Play/pause/stop functionality
- **State Management**: Tracks active/inactive days per schedule

#### Dynamic Features
- **Toast Notifications**: Custom notification system (`showToast()` function)
- **Chat Widget**: Simulated support chat (`openChatWidget()`, `closeChatWidget()`)
- **Property Loading**: Dynamic card generation (`loadMoreListings()`)
- **Referral System**: Form validation and processing (`processReferral()`)

#### Responsive Behaviors
- **Header Auto-hide**: Hides on scroll down, shows on scroll up
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Anchor links with smooth behavior
- **Parallax Effects**: Hero image transforms on scroll
- **Intersection Observer**: Fade-in animations on scroll

### CSS Architecture
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Design tokens in `:root`
- **BEM-like Naming**: Component-based class structure
- **Utility Classes**: Spacing and text alignment helpers
- **Media Queries**: Breakpoint at 768px for mobile

### JavaScript Patterns
- **Event Delegation**: Single DOMContentLoaded listener
- **Module Pattern**: Functions organized by feature (`setupNavigation()`, `setupDaySelectors()`, etc.)
- **State Management**: Complex state tracking for multiple interactive systems
- **Animation Control**: SetInterval/clearInterval for schedules with frame-based timing
- **Toast Notification System**: Centralized `showToast()` for user feedback
- **Modal Management**: Multi-screen authentication system with state transitions
- **URL Parameter Management**: Dynamic URL updates reflecting user selections
- **Focus Management**: Proper keyboard navigation and accessibility patterns

## Advanced Interactive Systems

### Multi-Modal Architecture
The application implements a sophisticated modal system with three distinct screens:
- **Welcome Screen**: Initial user greeting with navigation options
- **Login Screen**: Email/password authentication with validation
- **Signup Screen**: Multi-field registration with government ID matching requirements
- **State Transitions**: Smooth screen switching with proper focus management
- **Overlay Interactions**: Click-to-close and ESC key handling

### Schedule Animation Engine
Custom-built animation system simulating Lottie functionality:
- **Frame-Based Timing**: 0-100 frame range with 10fps animation speed
- **Control Interface**: Play/pause, stop, seek slider, loop toggle
- **State Persistence**: Animation states tracked per schedule type
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time day badge updates during animation
- **Performance Optimization**: Interval cleanup and memory management

### Day Selection State System
Sophisticated state management for rental day preferences:
- **Multi-State Tracking**: Active/inactive states per day across multiple contexts
- **URL Synchronization**: Real-time URL parameter updates
- **Cross-Component Communication**: State sharing between hero selector and schedule cards
- **Persistence**: State maintained across user interactions and page navigation
- **Validation**: Ensures at least one day selected for meaningful interactions

### Property Navigation System
Dynamic property redirect system with real data integration:
- **Property ID Management**: Real property IDs from original Split Lease site
- **Parameter Construction**: Dynamic URL building with current user state
- **Fallback Handling**: Default values when user state is incomplete
- **External Integration**: Seamless redirection to original site functionality

### Interactive Feedback Architecture
Comprehensive user feedback system throughout the application:
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive status messages with auto-dismiss
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during asynchronous operations
- **Hover Effects**: Immediate visual response to user interactions
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual cues for keyboard navigation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages

## Important Implementation Notes

### Asset Handling
- Images replaced with CSS gradients and emoji to avoid missing assets
- Logo uses initials "SL" in a styled div instead of image
- Property images use gradient placeholders

### GitHub Pages Compatibility
- All paths are relative for subdomain compatibility
- No external API calls (CORS-safe)
- Static content only (no server-side processing)

### Known Limitations
1. Chat widget is simulated (no backend)
2. Property listings are hardcoded examples
3. Referral system doesn't actually send messages
4. "Load More" generates placeholder content

### Security Considerations
- Original downloaded files contained API keys and were removed from git history
- Use orphan branch technique if secrets accidentally committed
- Never commit files from "Old files" directory

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Property Listings
Edit the `loadMoreListings()` function in script.js to add real data or modify the placeholder generation.

### Customizing Schedule Presets
Modify the `resetSchedule()` function to change default day selections for each schedule type.

### Changing Color Scheme
Update CSS custom properties in `:root` selector in styles.css:
- `--primary-color`: Main brand color
- `--primary-hover`: Hover state color
- `--text-dark`: Primary text color
- `--bg-light`: Background color

### Enabling Real Chat Support
Replace `openChatWidget()` function with actual chat service integration (e.g., Intercom, Drift, or custom WebSocket implementation).

## Development Methodology

### Systematic Reverse Engineering Approach
This project follows a unique **CYCLE-based development methodology** for achieving 1:1 functional parity with the original Split Lease website:

1. **Browser Automation Testing**: Use Playwright/browser tools to interact with original site
2. **Screenshot Analysis**: Capture and analyze visual states and interactions  
3. **Behavior Documentation**: Record exact URL patterns, parameter structures, and user flows
4. **Implementation**: Build matching functionality in the clone
5. **Validation**: Test clone behavior against original site patterns
6. **Immediate Deployment**: Commit and push every change for continuous integration

### CYCLE Development Pattern
Each development cycle focuses on one specific interactive element:
- **CYCLE N: [Feature Name]** - Systematic analysis and implementation
- **Browser Testing**: Test original site functionality with automated tools
- **Parameter Analysis**: Document exact URL patterns and data structures
- **Implementation**: Build matching behavior in clone
- **Validation**: Ensure 1:1 functional parity

### Key Development Principles
- **Immediate Git Commits**: Every change committed and pushed immediately
- **Original Site Integration**: Clone redirects to original site for backend functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build complex interactions incrementally
- **State Consistency**: Maintain consistent state across all user interactions
- **External Compatibility**: Ensure parameters match original site expectations

## URL REDIRECT LOCK (CRITICAL - DO NOT MODIFY)

**MANDATORY RESTRICTION**: All redirect URLs MUST use the domain `app.split.lease` (NOT `app.splitlease.app`). 

**🔒 LOCKED STATUS**: URL modifications are LOCKED and require explicit user authorization.

- **Authorized Domain**: `app.split.lease`  
- **Lock Implementation**: URL_LOCK mechanism in script.js (lines 10-28)
- **Source of Truth**: `all_split_lease_links.json` (contains all authorized URLs)
- **Last Authorized Change**: December 3, 2024
- **Violation Policy**: Any unauthorized URL changes must be reverted immediately

**DO NOT**:
- Change any URL from app.split.lease to any other domain
- Modify the URL_LOCK object in script.js
- Update redirect URLs without explicit user permission

**IF USER REQUESTS URL CHANGES**: Confirm they want to unlock URLs first before proceeding.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

**MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW**: Follow this exact pattern religiously for EVERY change:

### Git Workflow (REQUIRED FOR EVERY CHANGE):
1. **PULL FIRST**: Always run `git pull origin main` before making any modifications
2. **MAKE CHANGES**: Edit files as needed
3. **STAGE**: `git add [files]`
4. **COMMIT**: `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
5. **PUSH**: `git push origin main`

### ATOMIC STEPS AND VERIFICATION CYCLES (MANDATORY):
**CRITICAL**: For EVERY task, follow these atomic steps with iterative verification:

1. **MINIMUM 3 CYCLES, PREFERABLY 5**: Each task MUST undergo at least 3 verification cycles
2. **ATOMIC STEPS**: Break every task into smallest possible atomic steps
3. **ITERATIVE VERIFICATION**: After each change, verify it works before proceeding
4. **BUILD AND TEST**: Run build/test commands after each atomic step
5. **FIX AND RECHECK**: If issues found, fix and verify again (counts as new cycle)

**Verification Cycle Pattern**:
- **Cycle 1**: Initial implementation → Test → Document issues
- **Cycle 2**: Fix identified issues → Retest → Verify fixes work
- **Cycle 3**: Final validation → Confirm all requirements met
- **Cycle 4**: (Preferred) Edge case testing → Handle corner cases
- **Cycle 5**: (Preferred) Complete integration test → Final confirmation

**Example Workflow**:
```
Task: Fix sign-in redirect
Cycle 1: Remove delay → Test clicking → Works but has flash
Cycle 2: Remove toast message → Test again → No flash
Cycle 3: Test in multiple browsers → All working → Task complete
```

**This workflow applies to**:
- After EVERY file edit (HTML, CSS, JS, MD)
- After EVERY new feature addition
- After EVERY bug fix
- After EVERY refactoring
- No batching of changes allowed
- No exceptions - follow the workflow religiously

### Changelog Management:
- **MANDATORY**: Append detailed context to CLAUDE.md changelog after every change
- Include specific technical details, files modified, and reasoning
- Use reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Never skip changelog updates

This ensures continuous deployment, real-time GitHub Pages updates, and complete change tracking.

<!-- DEMO 1: Git workflow synchronization test -->
<!-- DEMO 2: Continuous synchronization across machines -->
<!-- DEMO 3: Multi-machine workflow validation -->
<!-- DEMO 4: Testing merge conflict resolution -->
<!-- DEMO 5: Final workflow validation complete -->
